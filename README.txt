MIS  :- 111703046
						GREP COMMAND
I have done -r -i -w -b -c -m -f -e -q -H -h options.
Also I have provided faciltiy to put multiple options in a command.

Some regular expressions are done.
"^word"
"word$"
w..d
[adw][pqo]rd

For searching the pattern I have used KMP algorithm.
For avoiding overlapping of results I used trie data structure.
