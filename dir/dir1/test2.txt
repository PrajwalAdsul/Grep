I felt great because 
I saw the others were Great
and because I knew I should feel happy,
but I wasnâ€™t really great happy 
so put a smile
but still I like greatness
and hate unhappyness
i know happyness is happiness
but everthing is fair for testing greatness
i am happy and so you should be great
